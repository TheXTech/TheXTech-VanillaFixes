This repo is meant to keep track of issues in Vanilla Episodes that occur on TheXTech.

When making new issues, make sure to add:

- The Episode Name.
- Source Link to the Episode.
- All relevant Level Names
- The MD5-Hash of the Archive, wld-files, and relevant lvl-files (can be displayed by [Gtkhash](https://github.com/tristanheaven/gtkhash/releases)).
- Screenshots or Recordings of the Issue.
- A description of what is needed to fix the Issue.
- If it's a packed episode with custom default set (like STTB or Yoshi's Archipelago), mention it.

Issues will get a need-flair and a priority-flair.

The need-flairs are:

- **needs-compat** - For issues that require to set a specific compat.ini value.
- **needs-patch** - For issues that require a real-time change to the level file.

The priority-flairs are:

- **PRIORITY 3 (TOP)** - Gamebreaking Issues introduced by TheXTech.
- **PRIORITY 2 (HIGH)** - Noticable Issues introduced by TheXTech.
- **PRIORITY 1 (LOW)** - Adding Enhancements and fixing Vanilla Bugs.
