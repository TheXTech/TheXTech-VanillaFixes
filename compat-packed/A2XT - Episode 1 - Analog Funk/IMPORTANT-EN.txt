== TheXTech conversion kit notes hints ==

=== 2014 assets 1.2.1 ===
This is the closed to original release of project which uses LunaDLL-v7.
Nothing special needed. Simply use the TheXTech-zing kit and apply the patch.

=== 2015 assets 1.3 ===
This is an updated version 1.3 which started to use LunaLua-SMBX (based on
LunaDLL-v8). There is a small thing you should take care to get this work
properly: Before running GFX conversion, you should rename "a2mbxt.exe" into
anything also, otherwise it's a fake executable which is a LunaLoader
masquarated.
Also, please use sounds.ini and music.ini from the patch as original set
is broken and will cause no music or sound works.
